AURA is a predictive analytics and risk management platform designed to forecast space weather events, quantify their financial impact, and provide actionable intelligence to insurers and asset operators.

## üö® Problem Statement
Space weather‚Äîencompassing solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and cosmic rays‚Äîposes a significant and growing threat to our technology-dependent world. These events can disrupt satellites, cripple power grids, and endanger aviation, leading to multi-million-dollar losses.

The core problem is that existing risk assessment is poor. Forecasts have limited lead time, and there's **no direct translation of space weather data into quantifiable financial risk**. This leaves satellite operators and insurers exposed and unable to effectively price or mitigate this cosmic threat. Our challenge was to design a system that bridges this gap.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Our Solution

### üó∫Ô∏è 1. Real-time Forecasting & Aurora Mapping
We provide an intuitive visualization of current and future geomagnetic activity, showing exactly where the impact will be felt.

* **72-Hour Kp-Index Forecast**: The system uses a custom-trained ML model to predict the Kp-index (a global measure of geomagnetic storm intensity) up to 72 hours in advance.
* **Interactive Global Map**: Forecasts are plotted on an interactive map that visualizes the aurora oval, helping operators understand the risk to assets in specific orbits.
* **Specialized Aviation Reports**: A dedicated agent analyzes high Kp-index events to generate detailed reports for the aviation industry, identifying high-risk polar routes and potential communication blackouts.

### üõ∞Ô∏è 2. Dynamic Risk Simulation
Our platform's core is a powerful "what-if" engine that allows users to simulate the impact of space weather on individual assets. This is crucial for underwriting and insurance pricing.

* **Asset Control Sliders**: Users can input key parameters for a satellite, including Shielding Hardness, Orbital Altitude, and Insured Asset Value.
* **Real-time Anomaly Calculation**: AURA runs a Monte Carlo simulation in the backend to model thousands of potential outcomes based on the forecasted storm intensity and asset parameters.
* **Probabilistic Output**: The result is a clear **Anomaly Probability (%)** and the **Calculated Financial Impact**, providing a solid foundation for pricing an insurance policy.

### üìà 3. Actuarial Insurance Premium Calculation
AURA moves beyond simple risk identification by translating complex space weather forecasts directly into a suggested insurance premium.

* **Dynamic Calculation Engine**: The premium isn't static. It's calculated dynamically using an actuarial formula: `Gross Premium = Pure Premium + Risk Margin + Expense Loading`.
* **Kp-Index Driven**: The **Pure Premium** is directly influenced by the live Kp-index. As the forecasted storm intensity rises, the probable loss increases, and the premium adjusts accordingly.
* **Asset-Specific Premiums**: The platform displays estimated premiums for various classes of assets (LEO, MEO, GEO), allowing underwriters to quickly assess risk.

### ü§ñ 4. AURA-Agent: The Expert AI Analyst
To make complex data accessible, we built AURA-Agent, a specialized AI chatbot powered by **Google's Gemini model**.

* **Expert Persona**: The agent acts as a data-driven risk analyst.
* **Grounded Responses**: Its knowledge is strictly limited to the project's problem statement and live alert data from NOAA, ensuring it provides answers that are factual, precise, and relevant.
* **Natural Language Interface**: Users can ask complex questions about methodology, current alerts, or risk factors and get immediate, easy-to-understand answers.

### üì≤ 5. Automated Alerting
Timely information is critical. AURA includes an integrated notification system to ensure stakeholders are informed the moment a threat emerges.

* **Live Alert Feed**: The dashboard ingests real-time alerts from official sources like the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center.
* **AI-Assisted Drafting**: Users can select a critical alert, and the AURA agent will instantly analyze its potential impacts and draft a clear, concise notification message.
